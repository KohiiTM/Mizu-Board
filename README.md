# Mizu Notes: Fluid On-Screen Annotation

**Mizu Notes** is a unique floating annotation tool that lets you draw and write directly _on top of_ your screen with effortless fluidity. It acts as your personal digital whiteboard, hovering above any application, window, or video.

**Mizu Notes is perfect for:**

- **Effortless Highlighting:** Instantly emphasize crucial points during presentations or while studying.
- **Contextual Quick Notes:** Add timely thoughts, reminders, or feedback directly onto any active window or video.
